NAME
----
megatools sync - Synchronize a local folder with a remote mega.nz folder


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'megatools sync' [-n] [-q] [--force] [--delete] [--no-progress] --local <path> --remote <remotepath>
'megatools sync' [-n] [-q] [--force] [--delete] [--no-progress] --download --local <path> --remote <remotepath>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Synchronizes remote and local directories. Files are overwritten if their size
or modification time is different.

Directories are only overwritten by files if the `--force` option is specified.
Use this option with caution. Files are always overwritten by a directory with
the same name.

Default direction is to upload files to the cloud. If you want to download
files, you have to add `--download` option.

Empty folders on Mega are not downloaded. Local symbolic links will not be
followed during upload. Files with a length of 0 bytes are not uploaded because
Mega doesn't support them.

If you make modifications on Mega it is possible that the local megatools cache
does not immediately reflect the changes. To make sure that you always operate
on the current set of files use the `--reload` option.

The option `--debug=app` displays info about file comparisons.

Details:

When uploading a file with 'sync', 'put' or 'copy' a custom attribute "_MT_LTS"
is used to store the local modification timestamp of the file on Mega. The
format is a unix timestamp (seconds since 1970/1/1 UTC). Directories are not
timestamped.

If an existing file is to be uploaded 'sync' compares the file sizes of the
local and remote versions. If they are the same the timestamp is compared. If
there are differences the file is transferred.

If the local timestamp on Mega is missing, for example when a file has been
uploaded using software other than megatools, 'sync' will use the upload
timestamp for the comparison. This makes sure that files that have been uploaded
to Mega using other software will not be synchronized more than once.

When a file is downloaded 'sync' will set its modification date on the local
file system to the timestamp obtained from Mega. The 'copy' and 'get' tools will
not set this timestamp. If you want to synchronize in both directions it is
therefore best to use 'sync' exclusively.

Please note that copying a file using the Mega web application will also copy
the local timestamp if available. When downloading this file with 'sync' the
file modification time will be the same as the original file's.


OPTIONS
-------

-r <remotepath>::
--remote <remotepath>::
	Remote directory path.

-l <path>::
--local <path>::
	Local directory path.

-d::
--download::
	Download files from the Mega.nz. The default is to upload.

-n::
--dryrun::
	Don't perform any actual changes, just print what would be done.

--no-progress::
	Disable upload progress reporting.

-q::
--quiet::
	Do not report file system operations. Only output messages and warnings.
	This option implies --no-progress and disables debug messages.

--delete::
	Delete files and folders in a target directory that are not present in
	the source directory.

--force::
	Overwrites folders in a target directory if the source is a regular
	file. If this option is not specified 'sync' will output an error for
	the target folder. Files that are to be replaced by a folder are always
	removed before the folder is being synchronized. Use this option with
	caution.
